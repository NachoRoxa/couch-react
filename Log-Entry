I don't know if this kind of stuff goes in the wiki because I can't get
to understand how that shit works, but I'll be using this file for an
entry log.

Well, this is the first entry and I just wanted to tell that after 
I installed/created the app the day before(02/12) I didn't do much
I left my work and go to training, didn't test it because you know
you create the app and it should work.

So today I decided to install Ant Desing, import it and run it and
there after I tiped "npm start" I saw a door to hell. A webpack error
and I was like wtf I don't recall of ever installed webpack... so 
there goes me and decided to install webpack, then another error, 
and so on so on and so on.
After some reading, I deleted de node-modules folder and the 
package-lock.json file, run npm install, and again HELL.
So after reading the error on the terminal updated core-js don't ask
why, on other apps it was just a warning, a fucking recommendation not
something critical, but I was desparate so updated, delete the folder,
the .json file, "npm install" yet again, and "npm start" and to my
surprise it works!! So now I'm kinda happy, I'll go and make me a tea
to finally start working on this shit.
Of course I'll make this the version 0.1.1 of the app on the master
branch, I don't want to start over again.
