# ChangeLog

I don't know if this kind of stuff goes in the wiki because I can't get
to understand how that shit works, but I'll be using this file for an
entry log.

Funny thing, after some research I found out that there some devs, maybe everyone,
when is working with Git creates a ChangeLod.md file... so well now this is it.

## [0.1.1] 09/12/2019

It's been hard to work on this bloody project, in my job I'm the only full time dev
so I have to do a lot of stuffs and also work as the IT guy, fixing some PCs, Wi-fi and stuffs.
It's an small business (PYME in Chilean Spanish) so... not complaining just saying it's my 1st job
as a professional so I'm doing my best or at least I'm trying.

About the Project, I just change some stuff in the project so here is the list
I have to mention that I've been reading the Keep A Changelog docs to understand better how
this file work. So thank you guys!
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

### Added

I created a Json file that has all the cities per region in Chile. I'm planing to use it in this projects
and maybe implement it on the Forms when creating an user account in the forms that my team creates.

### Changed

I change the package.json so that this project works with semi-standard style, yeah I'm a Fan of semicolons.

## [0.1.1] 03/12/2019

Well, this is the first entry and I just wanted to tell that after
I installed/created the app the day before(02/12) I didn't do much
I left my work and go to training, didn't test it because you know
you create the app and it should work.

So today I decided to install Ant Desing, import it and run it and
there after I tiped "npm start" I saw a door to hell. A webpack error
and I was like wtf I don't recall of ever installed webpack... so
there goes me and decided to install webpack, then another error,
and so on so on and so on.
After some reading, I deleted de node-modules folder and the
package-lock.json file, run npm install, and again HELL.
So after reading the error on the terminal updated core-js don't ask
why, on other apps it was just a warning, a fucking recommendation not
something critical, but I was desparate so updated, delete the folder,
the .json file, "npm install" yet again, and "npm start" and to my
surprise it works!! So now I'm kinda happy, I'll go and make me a tea
to finally start working on this shit.
Of course I'll make this the version 0.1.1 of the app on the master
branch, I don't want to start over again.
