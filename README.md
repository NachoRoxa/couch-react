Ok, I hope that this will be the last repo that I'll ever create for this shit.
In this seudo project I want to test a lot of stuff that I'm currently trying to learn, well actually... to be honest I've been trying the whole year, 2019.

## Thing that I'm trying to learn and implement

Well for the last seven months, since I finished my practice I wanted to learn React, but my knowledge on JS was not so good, outrageous to be more accurate, for that reason I started to learn JavaScript.

That went well for like a month, I get bored and lost enthusiasm and like many other thing I leave it there.

So now that I found a job, or the job found me, I don't remember to send my CV to that offer jajaja; I need to get my knowledge to the top learning this things:

- Of course the most critical is JS because they work with React so in order to be better at React I have to start with the basics.

- The Database is in CouchDB so I have to learn how to work JSON files and shit, so again JS.

- They have 2 projects one with Semantic-UI and the other with Ant Desing. I hate Ant because when I installed it on the last repo of the project it fucked up everything with the version of Webpack, but to be honest it was my mistake for not saving the project nor back it up on Git and it was on the master branch.

- Which brings me to the last thing that I'll be learning, Git. Don't get me wrong I know the basics of git is just that I don't have the habit of pushing everything, so I need to work on that. Also in my current job I work with one guy that have a real mess on one repo in Bitbucket, but really IS A FUCKING MESS! So, in order to work better I propose to implement GitFlow which will help us both since neither one of us have the habit of branching, featuring or keeping the repos in order.
